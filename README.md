# React with Vite Project

This is a React project set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and efficient build tool. This README will guide you on how to run and build the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running or building the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (Recommended version: LTS)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (Package manager)

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine (if you haven't done this already):

git clone https://github.com/Kaustubh-trivedi/react-screen-recorder.git


### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:


cd react-screen-recorder
npm install

## Running the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to view the app locally.

### Step 1: Run the Development Server
To start the development server, run:

npm run dev

By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your browser to see the app in action.


## Building the Project for Production
To create an optimized production build, run the following command:     

npm run build

This will generate a dist/ directory with production-ready files that you can deploy.
